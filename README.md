### Abstract
The new Spierdijk-Wansbeek test promises to be a new entry in the standard toolbox for 
applied panel data econometrics. Testing the strict exogeneity assumption necessary for the 
consistency of the widely used within estimator could before only be done when instruments
were already available. 

In this paper the standard SW test is compared to a modified, so-called unweighted (SWU) variant.
The SWU variant is investigated because it should give better results in the case 
of a singular (or nearly singular) covariance matrix, in contrast with the SW variant.
A simulation study is run and shows the unweighted test to be less powerful overall. Also
the unweighted test is not reliable when confronted with simultaneity when that relationship 
is weak. The standard SW test does not have this problem.

Both tests are applied to three research papers. In all three cases the standard SW test rejects the 
null hypothesis of consistency of the difference estimators, whereas the SWU test does
not. Due to the presence of more evidence in favor of the existence of endogeneity we conclude
that the unweighted test has not shown applicability in an empirical setting yet. 
Of special note is the third empirical case, where the covariance matrix is numerically singular
and still the SW test (using a generalized inverse) points to endogeneity whereas the SWU test does 
not. Other evidence from the data also points to endogeneity.

This paper is the first in investigating the properties of the unweighted test statistic,
results show the test performs worse than the standard SW test in most cases. More research
will be necessary to conclude whether the use of the unweighted test has any benefit over the 
standard Spierdijk-Wansbeek test.
